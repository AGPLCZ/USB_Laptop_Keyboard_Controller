The driver works perfect for this keyboard but I have a problem.
The problem is when using non english keyboard layout.
Whe I use **Marcel's Python matrix generator program** I must press keys as I were using english layout keyboard (mine is spanish layout) and then in Windows, selecting my language layout (spanish) everything is ok (locale symbols shows ok, i.e. 'ñ', '¿', '¡') but:
Spanish keyboard layout (phisical layout) is different from EN layout (there is a key between left shift key and 'Z' key, but there is only two keys between 'P' key and 'Enter' key.
This has some negative consequences:
- The most right key between 'L' key and 'Enter' key, marked in my keyboard whith symbos 'ç', 'Ç' and '}' doesn't work, when pressed, nothing happens.
- The key between left shift and 'Z' key is marked with '<' and '>' symbols but when pressed, it shows symbos for key described above, the key that doesn't work.
- '<' and '>' symbols can't be entered with any key (only using ALT+60 and ALT+62, of course)
